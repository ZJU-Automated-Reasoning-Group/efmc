# TODO(dimo): This code is fragile - too many potentially limiting
# assumptions about code shape. Should be removed when we
# moved to on-demand level generation as loops are
# discovered during dynamic exploration of the program.

# NOTE(dimo): The work to use lib/boogie/inv_networks.py to check
# if invariants are sufficient was half the work to obsolete this
# file.

# There are several implicit assumption in the loop code
# (these seem to hold for the desugared boogie code)
#
# 1) Each loop is identified by a unique header node
# 2) Each loop has a single exit point
# 3) All the relevant postcondition asserts are in the
#    immediate loop exit code
#
# 3) is particularly risky.
